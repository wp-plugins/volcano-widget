The plugin places a customizeable iframe containing an interactive map of volcanoes and earthquakes worldwide as widget into the sidebar.

== Description ==

The plugin creates a customizeable interactive map with active volcanoes and current earthquakes worldwide. 
The map is loaded in an iframe and can be used as widget that can be placed in a sidebar of the layout.

The map itself, which is being updated daily, contains interactive features:
- click on each earthquake to see details (depth, magnitude, time, source of data and link to detail info)
- submit a "I felt the earthquake" report straight from the earthquake list or the map
- click on each volcano to see more details (status, last activity, link to more info)
- access a list of latest volcano news

The map display can be customized in may ways:
- display only earthquakes or only volcanoes or both
- select a geographic region / country from a list (e.g. Australia, British Isles, California, Germany)
- select a custom geographic region defined by W-E and N-S boundaries
- start with different zoom and geographical center
- filter to show only quakes larger than a given magnitude
- filter to show only volcanoes at a certain activity level
- show / hide various display controls
